The HOPELite hands are designed to maximise cost against performance with very small BOM's.

The BOM stands for the Bill of Materials which is a complete description of every component that is required to assemble the design. The real cost to build a robot can be much higher depending on how hard it is to arrange delivery of every last component in the BOM. Reducing BOM size has cumulative advantages at many levels and is one of the top design priorities now.

This test of a finger structure replaces ball bearings with rolling joints that use the same size of fishing line as the tendons themselves (apologies that crimps are still required at this stage).

HOPELite: Open-source, DIY, humanoid robots

I want to foster a community that changes the world.

In a literal sense, the widespread adoption of robots is exactly that: the power to change the physical world with digital systems.

Open source has a crucial role to play in the development of this technology only if the tools are available to make that a practical reality for "the masses".

Open source software would clearly be a nonsense if they weren't billions of devices readily available for coding.

To this end, lowering cost whilst maintaining an adequate level of functionality is the highest design constraint.

The intention is to lever the tremendous performance increases that AI software offers to offset the significant differences in low cost hardware.

This is the great promise that needs testing: can AI genuinely control much lower cost hardware and finally produce the robots that we've all been dreaming of?

3d printed plastic robots offer tremendous precision but significantly lower stiffness, a trait that is true in fact of all the lower cost versions of components in a robot. Here there may be a happy coincidence because the problem with expensive hardware is that it cannot be safely used around people. Industrial robots are made of metal and remarkably stiff gearboxes to produce rapid, highly precise movements - like a robot.

But people don't move that way, we are bouncy and capable of feats of strength and precision that far outperform an industrial machine of similar weight and power.

So, we know it's possible to learn how to control a bouncy system and we know they're lower cost.

All that's missing are the plans and instructions to build a DIY population of humanoid robots.
